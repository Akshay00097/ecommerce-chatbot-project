## 🗂️ Intents & Entities

Watson Assistant uses **Intents** to identify the user's goal and **Entities** to extract data from input.

### 🎯 Intents (User Goals)
- `#create_account` – e.g., “Help me sign up”
- `#product_details` – e.g., “Tell me about iPhone 13”
- `#track_order` – e.g., “Where’s my order?”
- `#return_item` – e.g., “I want to return a product”

### 🧩 Entities (Contextual Info)
- `@product_name` – Product mentioned (e.g., iPhone 13)
- `@order_number` – Order ID (e.g., 12345)
- `@return_reason` – Reason for returning item

---

## 🗺️ Dialog Structure

The chatbot uses a **tree-like dialog flow**, where each **node** has:

- A **condition** (detected intent/entity)
- A **response** (message or action)
- Optional **API calls or custom logic**

This enables natural, contextual conversations that adapt to user inputs.
