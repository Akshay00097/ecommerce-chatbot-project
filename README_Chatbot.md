## 🗂️ Intents & Entities

IBM Watson Assistant uses **intents** (user goals) and **entities** (keywords/values) to understand and respond accurately.

### 🎯 Example Intents:
- `#create_account`
- `#product_details`
- `#track_order`
- `#return_item`

> _Example: “I want to track my recent purchase” → Intent: `#track_order`_

### 🧩 Example Entities:
- `@product_name` – e.g., iPhone 13  
- `@order_number` – e.g., 12345  
- `@return_reason` – e.g., wrong size

> _Example: “Where is my order 12345?” → Entity: `@order_number: 12345`_

---

## 🔄 Dialog Structure & Flow

The chatbot follows a **tree-like dialog structure** with:
- Conditions (based on intent/entity)
- Response (message, action, or next node)
- Context (to hold and reuse values in flow)

Each node is responsible for a specific function and ensures the conversation stays smooth and helpful.

## 🌐 Website Integration Code

You can embed the chatbot using the following HTML script:

```html
<script>
  window.watsonAssistantChatOptions = {
    integrationID: "YOUR-INTEGRATION-ID",
    region: "YOUR-REGION",
    serviceInstanceID: "YOUR-SERVICE-ID",
    onLoad: function(instance) { instance.render(); }
  };
  setTimeout(function() {
    const t = document.createElement('script');
    t.src = "https://web-chat.global.assistant.watson.appdomain.cloud/versions/latest/WatsonAssistantChatEntry.js";
    document.head.appendChild(t);
  }, 1000);
</script>
```
